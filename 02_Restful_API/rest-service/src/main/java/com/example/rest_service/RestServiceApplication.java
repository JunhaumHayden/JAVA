/*The Spring Initializr creates an application class for you. In this case, you do not need to further modify the class. The following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/restservice/RestServiceApplication.java) shows the application class:
 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers.

	//The main() method uses Spring Bootâ€™s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no web.xml file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

	//Test the Service

// Now that the service is up, visit http://localhost:8080/greeting, where you should see:
// {"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
// Provide a name query string parameter by visiting http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User. Notice how the value of the content attribute changes from Hello, World! to Hello, User!, as the following listing shows:
// {"id":2,"content":"Hello, User!"}
