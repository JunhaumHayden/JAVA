## Getting Started

Welcome to Code for Stock Control. It is a simple code implementation from a class. 
There are two files: MainApp.java with the main program and Produto.java with the Product class.

## How to use
When starting the program, an interactive menu is presented with the available options.
The program starts without products in stock, therefore, you must register the products from the menu.
After products are registered, the results will be better presented.

## Task Name:

EAD activity - about class and object

## Description:
From the class below, implement the following business rules:
  1) replace the quantity of product without exceeding the maximum quantity.
  2) withdraw a quantity without it being greater than the current quantity.
 
Implement a main application to create product objects and manipulate their stock using the replenish and withdraw methods.
If desired, insert several products into a list and create a menu of options to manipulate the objects in the list. Suggestion: insert new product; replace product; remove product; show current quantity; list all.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
